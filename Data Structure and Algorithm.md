# DSA (Data Structure and Algorithm)

> A *data structure* is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can bbe accessed and used efficiently. It defines the relationship between the data and the operations that can be performed on the data.

### Data structures are essential for the following reasons:

* **Efficient Data Management :** They enable efficient storage and retrival of data, reducing processing time and improving performance.
* **Data Organization :** They organize data in a logical manner, making it easier to understand and access.
* **Data Abstraction :** They hide the implementation details of data storage, allowing programmers to focus on the logical aspects of data manipulation.
* **Reusability :** Common data structures can be reused in multiple applications, saving time and effort in development.
* **Algorithm Optimization :** The choice of the appropriate data structure can significantly impact the efficiency of algorithms that operate on the data.

### Classification of Data Structures

> Data structures can be classified into two main categories :

* **Linear Data Structures :** These structures store data in a sequential order this allowing for easy *insertion* and *deletion* operations. Examples include trees, graphs and hash tables.
* **Non-Linear Data Structures :** These structures store data in a hierarchical or inter

### Types of Data Structures:

> Basically, data structures are divided into two categories :

#### Linear Data Structures :

* **Array :** A collection of elements of the same type stored in contiguous memory locations.
*  **Linked List :** A collection of elements linked together by pointers, allowing for dynamic insertion and deletion.
*  **Que :** A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) structure where elements are added at the end and removed from the beginning.
*  **Stack :** A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) structure where elements and removed from the top.

#### Non-Linear Data Structures :

* **Tree :** A hierarchical structure where each node can have multiple child nodes.
* **Graph :** A collection of nodes connected by edges, representing relationships between data elements.
* **Hash Table :** A data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to vlaues, allowing for fast lookup and insertion.

#### Applications of Data Structures

Data structures are widely used in various applications, including :

* **Database Management Systems :** To store and manage large amounts of structured data.
*  **Operating System :** To manage memory, processes, and files.
*  **Compiler Design :** To represent source code and intermediate code.
*  **Artificial Intelligence :** To represent knowledge and perform reasoning.
*  **Graphics and Multimedia :** To store and process images, videos and audio data.
