# Introduction to Programming

## Life Cycle of Problem to Code

* Problem Identification

Solving problems through programming begins with identifying and understanding the problem at hand.

* Algorith Designing

Algorithms are step-by-step instructions to solve a problem.

Algorithms help break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.

* Code Writing

Select an appropriate programming language based on problem requirements.

Convert the algorithm into code using programming constructs and syntax.

* Testing and Debugging

Test the code to ensure correctness and functionality.

Introduce unit testing, integration testing, and system testing.

* Deployment and Maintenance

Package, install and configure the program.

Use version control systems and proper documentation for maintenance and updates.

# Problem solving using Algorithms

To solve a problem using programming, the initial steps involve understanding the problem and creating a structured solution using an algorithm.

Let's take an example to further understand this concept. Imagine you have three numbers, and your goal is to write a code that automatically identifies the maximum or largest number among them.

An algorithm is a set of step-by-step instructions designed to solve a specific problem or achieve a task. Here is the algorithm for the problem statement "Finding the Maximum Number".

1. Start
2. Read three numbers : num1,num2,num3
3. If num1 is greater than num2 and num1 is greater than num3, then num1 is the maximum number.
4. If num2 is greater than num1 and num2 is greater than num3, then num2 is the maximum number.
5. If num3 is greater than num1 and num3 is greater than num2, then num3 is the maximum number.
6. Print the maximum number.
7. Stop.

A flowchart is a visual representation of a process or algorithm, using various symbols and arrows to illustrate the sequence of steps and decision points.
A flowchart is a graphical representation of the steps and decision-making process in a program. It helps programmers and other stakeholders visualize the flow of program execution and understand the logic.

A Pseudo code is a simplified and informal programming language-like description of an algoritm, used to outline the logic and structure of a program befor e wirting actual code.
Pseudo code is not a specific programming language but a technique to represent algorithms using simplified and human-readable language. It helps in planning and designing solutions before actual coding.

Machine language is a low-level programming language that is understood by computers directly. It uses binary digits (0's and 1's) to represent instructions and data.

Programming involves creating a set of instructions that a computer can follow to perform specific tasks or solve problems.

High-level programming languages  are designed to be easily understood by humans. They use keywords, symbols, and structures that resemble natural language, making it simpler for programmer to write and read code.

## Selecting an Optimal Programming Language

Selecting the right programming language is a critical step in code development Developers take various factors into account when choosing the optimal programming language for their solution. Some of these factors include :

* Type of application being developed
* Complexity of the application
* Maintenance requirements
* Scalability and Performance
* Security

## Classification of Programming Languages

Each programming language possesses unique features that make it suitable for specific application development. Now, look into the two main classes of programming languages.

* Low-Level programming Languages
A programming language can be called low-level when its architecture is closest to the machine or assembly language.
Low-Level programming languages have an architecture that cloely resembles machine or assembly language, making them less user-friendly for writing code.

* High-Level programming Languages
A programming language can be called high-level when its architecture is user-friendly and memory efficient.
High-Level programming languages are user-friendly for wirting codes as they are not closely related to machine or assembly language in terms of their architecture.
