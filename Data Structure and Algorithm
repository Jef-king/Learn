# DSA (Data Structure and Algorithm)

> A *data structure* is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can bbe accessed and used efficiently. It defines the relationship between the data and the operations that can be performed on the data.

### Data structures are essential for the following reasons:

* *Efficient Data Management :* They enable efficient storage and retrival of data, reducing processing time and improving performance.
* *Data Organization :* They organize data in a logical manner, making it easier to understand and access.
* *Data Abstraction :* They hide the implementation details of data storage, allowing programmers to focus on the logical aspects of data manipulation.
* *Reusability :* Common data structures can be reused in multiple applications, saving time and effort in development.
* *Algorithm Optimization :* The choice of the appropriate data structure can significantly impact the efficiency of algorithms that operate on the data.

### Classification of Data Structures

> Data structures can be classified into two main categories :

* *Linear Data Structures :* These structures store data in a sequential order this allowing for easy *insertion* and *deletion* operations. Examples include trees, graphs and hash tables.
* *Non-Linear Data Structures :* These structures store data in a hierarchical or inter
