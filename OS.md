# Operating System (OS)

* The OS sits as a bridge between users and the digital world within the entire technical ecosystem.
* It manages computer resources, including memory, storage, processing power, and input / output devices, to facilitate the execution of various tasks and user programs.
* The OS provides an envrionment for software to run efficiently and helps users interact with the computer.
* Example of OS includes Windows, Linux, MacOS, Andrioud etc.
* Understanding OS is crucial in programming because they provide the essential environment for software to run efficiently.
* OS like Windows, Linux, and Android act as a bridge between users and the digital world. They manage resources, such as memory and CPU, and handle tasks like process scheduling and input/output operations.
* Operating systems offer a set of essential services and abstractions that simplify and enhance the programming experience. They provide a standardized way to interact with hardware components, such as input/output devices, so that programmers don't have to write low-level code for each hardware variation.

## System Architecture

* System architecture, in the context of operating systems, refers to the fundamental design and structure of a computer system.
* It encompasses the hardware components, such as the central processing unit (CPU), memory, storage devices, input/output interfaces, and the relationships between them.
* System architecture also includes concepts like multi-core processors, buses, memory hierarchies, and peripheral devices. These components interact to execute instructions and process data.
